    "review1_descr": "The platform introduced me to incredibly strong and talented women who thrive despite unfavorable circumstances. They inspire me not to give up, to continue doing my work in my country. It's a place where you can find new colleagues, clients, and business partners. Implement your ideas and receive a lot of support.",

    "review2_name": "Roksolana OÅ‚ehiwna",
    "review2_descr": "I joined the Women in Business platform 2 years ago as an ambassador, having a small massage studio and two employees at that time. Just 2 months after joining, I was given the opportunity to speak at a conference. It was a significant challenge for me - to speak in front of a hundred successful women! But it was the beginning of my success and growth on the platform. In these two years, I tripled my business, expanded the team and premises, became a judge at an international championship, a brand trainer, and a teacher at a Ukrainian cosmetic company. I also opened my own educational center with an exhibition of massage equipment.",

    "review3_name": "Mariana",
    "review3_descr": "Marianka, a little girl who lived on the planet Theater, wanted to open up a new world for herself. She saw how far a beautiful diamond sparkled, where there were even more beautiful diamonds. And she felt that she could become one of those diamonds... and she did - a Mentor of the Ukrainian Women in Business platform. I was taught, guided, and pushed towards development. Support and a friendly atmosphere encouraged to be the Best among the Best. From a Girl to a Mentor, from an actress to a Trainer of Transformational Development. Thank you to Nadia Lysetskyi, Ola Dobrovolska - who believed. And to everyone I know and don't know yet. We are Real Beautiful and Smart. We are Ukrainian Kosachkas!",

    "review4_name": "Svitlana Terenchuk",
    "review4_descr": "Coming to the Women in Business platform, I expected to make new acquaintances, expand the geography of my business, and gain new knowledge. But I didn't expect to find such inspiration and completely change my perception of female partnership! It's a community that strengthens, motivates, where you unleash your potential and simply have a great time. Because a businesswoman is not only business, it's also WOMAN))) And we need beauty, love, and care. It's all here!",

    "review5_name": "Tetiana Kotukova",
    "review5_descr": "I became a member of the Women in Business platform in July 2023. It was a significant and weighty step in not only my business but also personal life. The platform is like a second family, I say it without exaggeration. The platform is support, attention to the opinion of each member, it's 100% positivity. But, in addition to positive emotions, the platform is also a unique opportunity for personal growth, quality workshops, workshops, training, festivals, various studies, and networking. The platform provides an opportunity to shine for everyone who wants to develop and move forward. Also, very important and valuable is that the platform has a clear purpose, quality management, and organization of the work process. From now on, I plan my life only together with the Ukrainian Women in Business platform!",

    "review6_name": "Aliona",
    "review6_descr": "The Ukrainian Women in Business platform is an inspiring and powerful community that has given me many new acquaintances and enriching conversations. Each member and mentor of the platform is valuable for their experience, an example of resilience, which strongly supports and inspires. Today, in the conditions of war, it is especially important - to have a circle of like-minded people who give a sense of wings and support. Thank you to Nadia Lysetskyi, who united and continues to attract the best women of Ukraine to this circle. On the platform, you can always get support and rethink your activities, expand horizons, and together approach Victory."
